Lands of the Forgotten Souls
____________________________

**Requires PYGAME to run** (portable pygame got discontinued)


WorkInProgress Game created by myself, where you play as a character wandering throughout a land composed of the lower houses, the main path & the castel (biggest part). 
You'll have a choice offered to you at the start of the game: Mage; Berserker; Knight or Archer. Which, for now, are only planned to be more visual effects than anything... 
Types of weapons will vary from a class to an other and they'll all (the weapon types depanding of the class choosen) have "elements" in the same order. 
Monsters are a thing too! From monsters visible on the map to "trap" monsters, they'll all have an increasing difficulty.

You'll have the main gameplay and the ghost one, idk what "ghost" will do but hey, it's WIP after all. Got some ideas tho.

The map will be manually layed out and monsters will have predefined areas in which they won't spawn, where it'll be safe for the player.
